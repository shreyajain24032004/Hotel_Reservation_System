Welcome to the **Hotel Reservation System** built with Java! 🌟 This is a simple command-line application that allows users to book available rooms in a hotel. The system displays room options, allows customers to select rooms, and confirms reservations based on availability.

## 🛏️ Features:
- **Available Rooms**: Displays a list of available rooms with prices.
- **Booking Process**: Allows customers to book rooms by selecting a room number and entering booking details.
- **Reservation Confirmation**: Users can confirm or cancel their reservation.
- **Room Availability Check**: Checks if the selected room is available before allowing the reservation.
- **Simple Interface**: A straightforward, text-based interface for user interaction.

## 🚀 How It Works:
1. **Room Listing**: The system shows a list of available rooms (Single Room, Double Room, Suite) along with their prices. If a room is unavailable, it will be marked as "Unavailable".
2. **User Input**: The user selects a room by entering the room number. If a room is available, they are asked to enter their name and the number of nights they plan to stay.
3. **Price Calculation**: The total price is calculated by multiplying the room price by the number of nights.
4. **Reservation Confirmation**: Users are prompted to confirm their booking. If confirmed, the room is marked as reserved, and the user is thanked for the reservation.
5. **Exit Option**: The user can choose to exit the system by entering `0`.
